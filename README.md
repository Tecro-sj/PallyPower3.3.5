## Last Fix
- Group Assignment works now. If you have any problems, let me know.
- I added two new funktions too debug /ppsync and /ppd. One is for sync between the PallyPower and the other ppd shows a chat output with all Paladins in grp/raid that are synced.

## Install Help
- Go into Interface/Addons and create a PallyPower folder
- Copy all files inside
- 
## TODO
- Test at max level
- Proper testing in group/raid

### Branches
- master: Retail 3.3.5
- ascension-oc9 : Ascensions upcoming Bronzebeard server.
